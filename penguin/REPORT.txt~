1. First, created additional classes (in file GLWidget.h) to be used for the body parts of a penguin. They are: polygon with six vertices for the body, polygon with five vertices for the head, and polygon with the four vertices for the arm. All of the three polygons were implemented as a given class UnitSquare, using several triangles and specifying the coordinates of their vertices.

2. The kinematic tree looks something like:
				     body
			       / /  \ \
			     /  /    \  \
			   /   /      \   \
	         head  arm    leg1 leg2
		    /  |           |    |
		   /   |           |    |
	    eye   beak      foot1   foot2
	    
So, if a body moves, then everything else do too w.r.t. body, but if only leg1 moves, then only foot1 moves with the leg (since it's a "child" of a leg1 and is dependent).
Each edge of a tree represents a joint.

In general, 
push
translate //transformations applied to every element
	push
		body //scale, draw
	pop
	
	push
		
	pop
	
3. Also, extended the given code with additional spinners (in file MainWindow.h) for the new DOFs. The spinner for the left and right leg, as well as left and right foot, is shared. Added different joint angles and other values for the lengths of different body parts (in file GLWidget.cpp).}
